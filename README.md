Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Projects
Thanks for stopping by my GitHub repo! Here youâ€™ll find a collection of projects Iâ€™ve been working on to build my skills in web design and Java programming. Whether you want to learn a bit about me or check out some of my code, youâ€™re in the right place.

Whatâ€™s Inside?
ðŸŒŸ My Portfolio Website
Built with HTML and CSS, this is where I showcase who I am, what I do, and what Iâ€™m passionate about. Itâ€™s simple, clean, and responsive â€” perfect for sharing my professional story online.

ðŸ“š Grade Calculator (Java)
A basic Java program that helps calculate grades. Itâ€™s a straightforward console app, great for beginners to understand how to take user input and work with calculations.

âœ… CSS Validation Form
A neat HTML form styled purely with CSS that shows how to do validation without any JavaScript. Itâ€™s all about making forms user-friendly and visually appealing.

ðŸ§® Calculator Using Java OOP
Here, I dive into object-oriented programming by building a calculator in Java. Itâ€™s a fun way to practice organizing code into classes and objects.

ðŸ”¢ Factorial Calculator Using Recursion
A simple Java program that calculates factorials using recursion. This helped me get comfortable with recursive functions â€” a really important concept in programming.

How to Try These Out
For the web projects (Portfolio & Form):
Just open the .html files in your favorite web browser, and youâ€™re good to go! You can also tweak the CSS files to see how styles change.

For the Java projects:
Make sure you have Java installed. Then, from your command line:

Compile the code: javac FileName.java

Run it: java ClassName

Easy!

Why These Projects?
They helped me learn the basics and some advanced concepts of Java programming.

I got to practice writing clean and simple HTML/CSS code.

Built a portfolio to share my journey and work with the world.

Explored cool ideas like form validation without JavaScript and OOP design.
